# Unreal-Battery-Game
Introduction project into C++ scripting in Unreal, the goal of the game is to run around and pickup batteries as they fall to increase your power before it runs out and you lose.

The goal of this project was to learn how to program a game in unreal fully using C++ scripting versus the visual scripting method provided in Unreal. All the mechanics of the game are done in C++ scripting and the player is able to move around using WASD so that they can grab the batteries that fall to the ground so they can extend the gameplay timer that is a bar on the top of the screen that represents your robots power level remaining.
